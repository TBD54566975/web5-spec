## Important!

Make sure that if you are updating a test vector that you test in the following repos before merging!

https://github.com/TBD54566975/web5-js
https://github.com/TBD54566975/web5-kt
https://github.com/TBD54566975/web5-swift

Clone each repo locally, make sure that each web5-spec submodule is pointed to your branch, and then run tests to make sure it is still passing in all repos!
